ðŸ’¼ My Portfolio Website

This is a simple portfolio website created using HTML and basic CSS. It includes two main pages:

Home Page â€“ A brief introduction about me and my work.

Contact Page â€“ A section where visitors can find my contact details.

This project was built to showcase my basic web development skills and serve as a foundation for future improvements.
